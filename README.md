# easy-PHP-for-programmers
There are many individuals like me who are lazy to learn PHP7. So I learned PHP7 and combined all the topics from basics to advance in a single code file in much readable form with a lot of comments. This document is a standalone PHP7 basic tutorial for PHP beginners. It can give readers/users/programmers an idea about how PHP actually looks like and what is different in it than other programming languages and what syntax are same as other languages.

If you would like to contribute, feel free to do so :-)
